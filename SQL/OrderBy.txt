ORDER BY FirstName 

--will order it by 2nd column i.e Lastname--
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Sales.vIndividualCustomer
ORDER BY 2

--will order it by lastname using it alias--
SELECT FirstName , LastName AS [Customer Last Name]
FROM Sales.vIndividualCustomer

SELECT FirstName , LastName AS [Customer Last Name]

--NOTE :
Way of writing a query is in the order :
SELECT
FROM
WHERE
GROUP BY
HAVING
ORDER BY

The order by clause can execute stmnts with the column alias name .
Others cannot do it with alias name because the order in which a query is executed by sql is:
Way of writing a query is in the order :

FROM
WHERE
GROUP BY
HAVING
SELECT
ORDER BY

Since the select stmnt executes before order by , sql knows the column alias name so order by can execute it with alias.
whereas the other clauses like where executes before select so it does not recognise any alias hence it will give error.

SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Sales.vIndividualCustomer
